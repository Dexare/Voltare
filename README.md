Voltare is a version of the [Dexare](https://github.com/Dexare/Dexare) framework for [Revolt](https://revolt.chat). Easily make modules that depend on others or overwrite their functions.

> Note: This is still in development. As [better-revolt-js](https://github.com/TheMaestro0/better-revolt.js) is still new, this framework may have some bugs.

Documentation is unavailable at the moment, but some of the core features of Voltare is shown in the [Documentation for Dexare](https://github.com/Dexare/Dexare/wiki).
